# 💔 EX-TERMINATOR: The Ultimate Breakup Battle 💔

You've ghosted them, blocked their numbers, and burned every love letter...  
But they're back — ALL of your exes — and they are pissed.

EX-TERMINATOR is a hilarious and intense Pygame action game where your love life becomes your battlefield.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- 🗡️ You = the sword-wielding gladiator of love.
- 💔 Your exes = vengeful, pixelated nightmares.
- 🧠 Survive 20 escalating phases — each bringing more furious exes (5 per wave).
- ❤️ You have 3 HP — one for each time your heart's been broken.
- 💥 Lose them all, and you're not just dumped... you're done.

Grab your sword. Swing like your love life depends on it.  
Because in this arena — it does.
